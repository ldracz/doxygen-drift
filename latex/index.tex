The Oculus Drift provides three control schemes for controlling a firefly asctec drone using an oculus rift and keyboard. The Oculus Drift consists of four nodes that can be run.

Oculus-\/drift republishes images from the firefly stereo camera to the oculus

Oculus-\/control provides the first control scheme using the Oculus orientation info

With this node it is possible to move into any position using the proper sequence of commands.

oculus-\/control-\/alternative provides a similar control scheme as oculus-\/control but limits

the oculus to the xy plane it is currently located and changes tilting in the z axis to movement

in the left or right of the robot.

oculus-\/control-\/keyboard allows the control of the firefly drone through keyboard commands in the

terminal (that needs to be active).
